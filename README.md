    üíº Experience
  </summary>
  <div>
    <h2>Data Engineer</h2>
    <i>November 2023 - PRESENT</i><br>
    <i>at Norsk Hydro</i><br><br>
    <p>My primary focus is learning and familiarizing myself with our data platform and workflow processes. Our technology stack includes Azure, Python, and Java for development, along with tools like Databricks and Azure Data Factory.</p>
    <p>My initial project involved creating a Python-based web scraper to gather Hacker News posts, which are then processed and stored using Azure Data Factory. This experience has deepened my understanding of data pipeline orchestration and data processing.</p>
    <p>I am committed to contributing effectively to the team's goals while continually improving my skills in Python, Java, and Azure technologies.</p>

    <h2>M365 Trainee</h2>
    <i>February 2023 - November 2023</i><br>
    <i>at Norsk Hydro</i><br><br>
    <p>I began by acquiring fundamental knowledge in Active Directory and Azure Active Directory, laying the groundwork for my professional growth.</p>
    <p>My primary role involved data management tasks, including data collection, cleaning, aggregation, and presenting information in a user-friendly format. I leveraged PowerShell and occasionally Python to streamline these processes, enhancing efficiency within the team.</p>
    <p>Notably, my work played a role in supporting the management team's decision-making processes. The insights from the data I managed and presented contributed to informed choices and strategies, ultimately benefiting the organization.</p>
    <p>A milestone as a trainee was the positive feedback I received from my mentor and supervisor. Their support and guidance allowed me to transition into a full-time role at Norsk Hydro.</p>

  <div>
    <h2>Software Developer (Java)</h2>
    <i>January 2021 - November 2022</i><br>
    <i>at Seacon Europe</i><br><br>
    <p>First, I began with small tasks to understand the company's main project structure. As I steadily proved my capabilities through these initial assignments, they entrusted me with my first independent project.</p>
    <p>For this project, I developed a highly parameterizable application responsible for reading and processing data from robots within an industrial environment. This experience allowed me to contribute meaningfully to the team's efforts without overemphasizing my role.</p>

    üìã About me
  </summary>
  <div>
    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p>
      I started learning programming in 2012 at the age of 13. I have learned and worked in many areas, but game development has always been the most interesting.<br>
      I had contract jobs, including video/image processing, high-volume data processing, program module, and API development. Lately, I've been teaching mathematics, informatics, and programming to high school students.<br>
      I wrote my thesis work on mixed reality application development, which included detecting objects in real-time, placing virtual entities ‚Äì visible through the screen or AR glasses ‚Äì in the real world, and giving users options to interact with these entities.
    </p>
    <h2>Hobbies and plans</h2>
    <p>
      Besides video games, I am interested in music, especially playing the piano, chess, and puzzles. When I have the opportunity, I like to go touring and kayaking. I live in Hungary and will spend the next semester in Finland at Metropolia University. After my education, I plan to move abroad, and my primary destination is Finland. I started learning Finnish in June 2022 and plan to take a B2-level language exam in 2024. I also speak a little German but haven't practiced since graduating.
