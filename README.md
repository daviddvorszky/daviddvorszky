    üìã About me
  </summary>
  <div>
    <h3>Activities</h3>
    <p>
      I started learning programming 11 years ago, at the age of 13. I have learned and worked in many areas, but game development has always been the most interesting.<br>
      I had contract jobs, including video/image processing, high-volume data processing, program module, and API development. Lately, I‚Äôve been teaching informatics and programming to high school students.<br>
      I wrote my thesis work on mixed reality application development, which included detecting objects in real-time, placing virtual entities ‚Äì visible through the screen or AR glasses ‚Äì in the real world, and giving options for the users to interact with these entities.
    </p>
    <h3>Hobbies and plans</h3>
    <p>
      Besides video games, I am interested in music, especially playing the piano, chess, and puzzles. When I have the opportunity, I like to go touring and kayak. I live in Hungary and will spend the next semester in Finland at Metropolia University. After my education, I plan to move abroad, and my primary destination is Finland. I started learning Finnish in June and plan to take a B2-level language exam in early 2023. I also speak a little German but haven‚Äôt practiced since graduating.
